This view, known as the Steady State theory, held that the universe had no beginning or end. Influenced by the teachings of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, many believed the universe was infinite in both space and time, existing in a constant state without origin or creation.</p><h2>Key characteristics of this theory included:</h2><ol><li><strong>Eternal Universe:</strong> The universe had always existed and was infinite in age.</li><li><strong>Unchanging Universe:</strong> The universe was believed to be in a steady, static state, with no expansion or contraction.</li><li><strong>No Creation Event:</strong> The idea of a universe emerging from "nothing" or undergoing an origin was considered unnecessary and even illogical according to this model.</li></ol><p>This belief was so deeply rooted that most scientists resisted any theory that suggested the universe had a beginning. In fact, the Steady State theory was the prevailing scientific understanding of the cosmos up until the early 20th century.</p><h2>Criticism of the Quran for Stating a Universe with a Beginning</h2><p>When the Quran was revealed over 1,400 years ago, it described the universe in a way that suggested it had a definite origin — a concept that seemed strange and counterintuitive to those who believed in an eternal universe. Some critics of the Quran pointed to this as evidence that it was out of sync with the widely accepted views of the time.</p><p>For example, the Quran mentions:</p><blockquote><p>"Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and the earth were once one mass, then We split them apart?"</p><footer>(Quran 21:30)</footer></blockquote><p>Critics argued that this verse was inconsistent with the idea of an eternal, static universe. The idea of the universe having a starting point was dismissed, and the suggestion that it was once a single entity that was separated seemed far-fetched in the context of scientific knowledge at the time.</p><h2>The Shift: The Big Bang Theory</h2><p>In the early 20th century, however, discoveries in physics and astronomy began to challenge the Steady State theory. In 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble made a groundbreaking observation that distant galaxies were moving away from us. This led to the understanding that the universe was expanding. If the universe was expanding, it must have been smaller in the past, leading scientists to the conclusion that the universe must have originated from a singular point.</p><p>This singular point is described as a singularity — an infinitely small, dense, and hot state from which the universe began. This event, now known as the Big Bang, is considered the birth of the universe, marking the creation of space, time, matter, and energy.</p><h2>Key points of the Big Bang theory include:</h2><ol><li><strong>Singularity:</strong> The universe began as an infinitely small, dense point.</li><li><strong>Expansion:</strong> The universe rapidly expanded, creating space and time as it grew.</li><li><strong>Formation of Matter:</strong> As the universe cooled, particles formed, leading to the creation of stars, galaxies, and planets.</li><li><strong>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation:</strong> The leftover heat from the Big Bang is still detectable today, serving as strong evidence for this theory.</li></ol><p>This new understanding of the universe provided strong evidence that the universe did indeed have a beginning, which directly contradicted the Steady State theory.</p><h2>Quran And Modern Cosmology</h2><p>Remarkably, many of the descriptions of the universe in the Quran, revealed centuries before modern science could confirm them, align with the Big Bang theory:</p><h3>1. The Universe Began as a Singular Entity</h3><blockquote><p>"Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and the earth were once one mass, then We split them apart?"</p><footer>(Quran 21:30)</footer></blockquote><p>This verse mirrors the scientific description of the universe's origin as a single entity (singularity) that expanded and formed the universe as we know it today.</p><h3>2. The Expanding Universe</h3><blockquote><p>"And the heaven, We constructed it with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander."</p><footer>(Quran 51:47)</footer></blockquote><p>This verse explicitly mentions the expansion of the universe, a concept that was only discovered by science in the 20th century when Hubble observed the redshift of galaxies, indicating they were moving apart as the universe expands.</p><h3>3. Smoke After Big Bang</h3><blockquote><p>"Then He turned to the heaven when it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, 'Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion.' They said, 'We have come willingly.'</p><footer>(Quran 41:11)</footer></blockquote><p>Scientists describe the early universe as being filled with a hot, dense plasma that could be described as "smoke." This phase of the universe, before matter formed, is reflected in the Quran's description of the heavens being in a smoke-like state.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Before the 1920s, most scientists firmly believed in the Steady State theory, which posited that the universe had no beginning and was eternal. The idea that the universe could have originated from a single point or "nothing" seemed implausible. Consequently, Quranic verses suggesting a created universe were often dismissed as inconsistent with scientific knowledge.</p><p>However, the discovery of the Big Bang theory in the 20th century revolutionized our understanding of the universe. It demonstrated that the universe did indeed have a beginning, and its expansion is ongoing. This modern scientific understanding aligns remarkably well with verses from the Quran, which describe the creation of the universe in a way that resonates with the Big Bang theory.</p></body></html>",

The Holy City, a significant religious center for Christians, was looted, and many sacred relics were taken. The Roman Emperor Heraclius, who had only recently taken power, faced overwhelming odds. The empire was in turmoil, with many believing that the Roman rule was coming to an end.</p><p>The defeat of the Byzantines took place near the region of the Dead Sea, geographically significant as it is the lowest land point on Earth. This battle and the subsequent humiliation of the Byzantine Empire were seen as major triumphs for the Persians, and for a time, it appeared that the Byzantines would never recover.</p><h2>The Quranic Prophecy</h2><p>At this moment of despair for the Byzantines, the Quran revealed an astonishing prophecy in Surah Ar-Rum:</p><blockquote><p>Alif, Lam, Meem. The Romans have been defeated in the lowest land, but they, after their defeat, will overcome. Within three to nine years. To Allah belongs the command before and after. And that day the believers will rejoice.</p><footer>(Quran 30:1-4)</footer></blockquote><h2>The Significance of the Prophecy</h2><p>This verse is remarkable for several reasons:</p><ol><li>It predicts that the Byzantine Empire, despite its crushing defeat, would rebound and achieve victory over the Persians within a short span of time — three to nine years.</li><li>Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when, in 627 CE, Emperor Heraclius launched a series of brilliant military campaigns, culminating in a decisive victory over the Persian forces at the Battle of Nineveh.</li><li>By 629 CE, the Byzantines had regained much of their lost territory, including Jerusalem, in an astonishing turnaround.</li></ol><h2>The Geographical Precision</h2><p>What elevates this verse beyond its historical accuracy is the precise description of the location where the Byzantine defeat occurred: in the lowest land (adna al-ardh). The region of the Dead Sea, where this defeat took place, is scientifically the lowest point on Earth's land surface, sitting approximately 430 meters (1,410 feet) below sea level.</p><p>This fact about the Dead Sea's topography could not have been widely known at the time of the Quran's revelation, as such measurements were beyond the scientific capabilities of the 7th century. Yet the Quran makes this reference with remarkable precision.</p><h2>The Linguistic Depth</h2><p>The term adna in Arabic can mean both nearest and lowest, making the verse a multi-layered expression, referring both to the geographical proximity of the defeat and the literal fact that it occurred at the Earth's lowest land point. This dual meaning enriches the intellectual depth of the Quran's language, as it not only provides a specific location but also implies a deeper understanding of the natural world.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The prophecy in Surah Ar-Rum stands as a testament to the Quran's profound insight into historical events and the natural world. The accurate prediction of the Byzantine victory and the precise description of the Dead Sea as the lowest land demonstrate the Quran's extraordinary alignment with both historical fact and scientific discovery.</p><p>At a time when no one could have imagined the recovery of the Byzantine Empire or known the unique geographical features of the Dead Sea, the Quran delivered a message that transcends human knowledge, offering not only a historical account but also an intellectual reflection on the nature of divine wisdom.</p></body></html>"
